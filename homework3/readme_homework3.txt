Question:

1) I have tried the reduce command but it is actually slower than for-loop (homework3_1.py). Do you know why?

2) In the logistic regression, it seems I have to assume data above the lines is 0 because of the definition of inference. Isn't this strange? If I manually flip the sign, of course it will work. But shouldn't the code work in both cases without manual modification?

homework_1_np and homework_2_np are the codes. The figure is the answer to Q3.
